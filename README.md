## What is MDDEM?

MDDEM is a particle simulation engine written in Rust, supporting both **Discrete Element Method (DEM)** for granular materials and potentially **Molecular Dynamics (MD)** (still learning this side).

The framework is built around **composability**. A dependency-injection scheduler inspired by [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) and a plugin system let you assemble simulations from independent, reusable pieces. Physics models, integrators, neighbor lists, and output formats are all plugins. Systems declare their resource dependencies as function arguments; the scheduler injects them automatically and resolves execution order.

Configuration follows a **two-tier** approach:

- **Tier 1 — Declarative TOML** for standard simulations: named fields, typed values, validated at startup.
- **Tier 2 — Rust API** for complex simulations: `main.rs` composes plugins, and custom systems are real functions with full type safety and IDE support.

Both tiers can be mixed freely. The [hopper](examples/hopper/) example uses TOML config alongside custom Rust systems for runtime wall control.

## Motivation

MDDEM began as a Rust reimplementation of LAMMPS communication patterns, motivated by a desire to **explore whether a scheduler with dependency injection could work for particle simulations**. 


## Design Notes

MDDEM uses TOML for input configuration. I don't like this, Still exploring alternative ideas to input configurations. 


## Quick Start

### DEM: Granular Gas

**`main.rs`**
```rust
use mddem::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    app.add_plugins(CorePlugins)
        .add_plugins(GranularDefaultPlugins);
    app.start();
}
```

MDDEM is not yet published on crates.io. Add it as a git dependency:

**`Cargo.toml`**
```toml
[dependencies]
mddem = { git = "https://github.com/SueHeir/MDDEM" }
```

To build without MPI (single-process mode):

```toml
[dependencies]
mddem = { git = "https://github.com/SueHeir/MDDEM", default-features = false }
```

**`config.toml`**
```toml
[domain]
x_high = 0.025
y_high = 0.025
z_high = 0.025
boundary_x = "periodic"
boundary_y = "periodic"
boundary_z = "periodic"

[neighbor]
skin_fraction = 1.1
bin_size = 0.005

[[dem.materials]]
name = "glass"
youngs_mod = 8.7e9
poisson_ratio = 0.3
restitution = 0.95
friction = 0.4

[[particles.insert]]
material = "glass"
count = 500
radius = 0.001
density = 2500.0
velocity = 0.5

[run]
steps = 10000
thermo = 100
```

### MD: Lennard-Jones Fluid

**`main.rs`**
```rust
use mddem::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    app.add_plugins(CorePlugins).add_plugins(LJDefaultPlugins);
    app.start();
}
```

**`config.toml`**
```toml
[domain]
x_high = 10.06
y_high = 10.06
z_high = 10.06
boundary_x = "periodic"
boundary_y = "periodic"
boundary_z = "periodic"

[neighbor]
skin_fraction = 1.12
bin_size = 1.0

[lattice]
style = "fcc"
density = 0.85
temperature = 0.85
mass = 1.0
skin = 1.25

[lj]
epsilon = 1.0
sigma = 1.0
cutoff = 2.5

[thermostat]
temperature = 0.85
coupling = 1.0

[run]
steps = 100000
thermo = 1000
```

### Running

```bash
# Single process
cargo run --release -- config.toml

# With MPI (build first, then launch)
cargo build --release
mpiexec -n 4 ./target/release/my_simulation config.toml

# Print the compiled schedule for your specific simulation (Graphviz DOT)
cargo run --release -- config.toml --schedule
```

`CorePlugins` bundles config loading, communication, domain decomposition, neighbor lists, groups, and output. `GranularDefaultPlugins` adds DEM contact physics, rotational dynamics, particle insertion, and Velocity Verlet integration. `LJDefaultPlugins` adds FCC lattice, LJ forces, Nosé-Hoover thermostat with fused Verlet integration, and measurements. Individual plugins can be added separately for custom configurations. The App / Plugin / Scheduler / TOML / multi-stage run substrate lives in the [grass](https://github.com/elizabeth-suehr/grass) workspace — see its READMEs for details.
